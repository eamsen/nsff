# NSFF - Not So Fast Farward
by Eugen Sawin <esawin@me73.com>

## Version
This is the winning version of the Hackolaus, a 24h programming contest at the
University of Freiburg, Germany.  

### Remarks
Please do **not** learn from this code. The competition ranked, besides
performance and correctness, also (uncommented) code size in number of bytes.
So one goal was to provide very dense code. I can proudly say, this is
the *worst code* I have written.
